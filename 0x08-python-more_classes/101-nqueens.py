N-Queens Solver

This module provides a program to solve the N-Queens problem
and print all possible solutions.

Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1.
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4.
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number,
followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1.
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1.
The program should print every possible solution to the problem.
One solution per line.
Format: see example.
You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order.
You are only allowed to import the sys module.
